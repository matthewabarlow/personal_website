## **Research Interests**

My research interests are at the intersection of entrepreneurship, organization theory, and strategic management.  I use various theoretical lenses from across disciplines, with the main focus of my research being the role that different stakeholder groups, both inside and outside of the firm, have on organizational performance and value creation.  With this overarching question, I have three separate, but related research streams.  The first research stream focuses on the creation of entrepreneurial opportunities and entrepreneurial performance.  The second major research stream focuses on the impact that outside stakeholders’ perceptions have on the performance of entrepreneurial organizations. Finally, the third stream focuses on human capital, both in exisintg and nascent organizations.
