I am currently an Assistant Professor of Management in the College of Business Administration, University of Texas at El Paso. I received my Ph.D. in Business Administration from the University of Utah in 2016 and previously earned an MBA from Indiana University, a M.S. in Electrical Engineering from George Washington University, and a B.S. in Electrical Engineering from Virginia Tech.

My research interests focus on entrepreneurship, organization theory, and human capital. I teach courses in Entrepreneurship and Business Strategy and both the undergraduate and graduate level.  I am a member of the [Academy of Management](http://www.aom.org), the [Strategic Management Society](http://www.strategicmanagement.net), and the [Western Academy of Management](http://www.wamonline.com). Prior to my graduate studies, I was an electrical engineer for both the U.S. Department of Commerce and the U.S. Department of Defense.
